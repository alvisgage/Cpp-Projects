This lab is an excellent example of how to use and manipulate vectors. It is a lesson on the differences between vectors and arrays. I utilized a MusicLibrary, Song, and utility class to create libraries of songs. The songs included 8 members: title, composer, artist, album, file path, year, genre, and file format. Songs can be added if they don't already exist, and removed by entering a song or index number. The libraries can print to the screen and save to a file. Getter and setter functions can also be utilized to manipulate characteristics of songs. The "<<" operator was overloaded to allow easy output of individual songs.
